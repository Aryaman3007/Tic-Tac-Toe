# Tic-Tac-Toe

**Demo-Link** : https://tic-tac-toe-aryaman3007.vercel.app/

This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Installation**
To run the game, simply download the project files and open the index.html file in your web browser. The game does not require any additional libraries or dependencies.

**How to Play**
The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking either an "X" or an "O" on the grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is considered a tie.

To make a move, simply click on the space where you want to place your mark. The game will alternate between the "X" and "O" markers for each player. The game will display the current state of the grid after each move, and will inform you if you have won, lost, or tied the game.

**Customization**
The game's appearance can be customized by editing the CSS in the style.css file. Additionally, the game's behavior can be modified by editing the JavaScript in the script.js file. For example, you could change the size of the grid, or add additional logic to determine the winner.
